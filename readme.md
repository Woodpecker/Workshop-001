# Workshop-001
This is some primitive code I use for my Workshops when teaching HTML5, CSS3 and JS basics.
HTML - Example HTML5 doc template + a few elements
CSS - Minimal declarations for some basic styling and MQ layout
JS - Just an event listener that toggles a class on an element (by ID)
##Extreme stuff.
